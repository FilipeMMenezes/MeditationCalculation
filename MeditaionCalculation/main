# Complete the meditate function using a while loop. It takes mana, max_mana, energy and energy_potions integers.

# 1-While meditating, a character converts 1 energy into 3 mana — their mana cannot exceed their max mana — for each iteration of the loop.
# 2-mana cannot exceed the max_mana.
# 3-If they have any energy_potions when they run out of energy, they will use 1 energy potion to gain 50 energy and continue meditating.
# 4-A character will stop meditating if either:
#   -Their mana reaches the max_mana, or
#   -They run out of energy and energy_potions.

# Coding challenge from boot.dev this is my take on the puzzle.
